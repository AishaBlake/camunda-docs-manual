Re-deploys an existing deployment.

The deployment resources to re-deploy can be restricted by using the properties `resourceIds` or `resourceNames`. If no deployment resources to re-deploy are passed then all existing resources of the given deployment are re-deployed.

{{< note title="Security Consideration" class="warning" >}}
  Deployments can contain custom code in form of scripts or EL expressions to customize process behavior. This may be abused for remote execution of arbitrary code. See the section on <a href="{{< ref "/user-guide/process-engine/securing-custom-code.md">}}">security considerations for custom code</a> in the user guide for details.
